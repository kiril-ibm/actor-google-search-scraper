## Features

This SERP API actor crawls Google Search Result Pages (SERP or SERPs) and extracts data from the HTML to a structured format such as JSON, XML or Excel. Specifically, the actor extracts the following data from each SERP:

- Organic results
- Ads
- Product ads
- Related queries
- People also ask
- Price, reviews rating and count (under `productInfo` field if available)
- Additional custom attributes

Note that the actor doesn't support special types of Google searches, such as [Google Shopping](https://www.google.com/shopping),
[Google Images](https://www.google.com/imghp) or [Google News](https://news.google.com).

## SERP API

Our Google Search Results Scraper gives you a RESTful SERP API that provides real-time results optimized for structured JSON output that you can download and use any way you want.

## Cost of usage

The actor is free to use, but to scrape SERPs effectively, you should use [Apify Proxy](https://apify.com/proxy) and need to have a sufficient limit for Google SERP queries (you can see the limit on your [Account](https://my.apify.com/account) page).

New Apify users have a free trial of Apify Proxy and Google SERPs, so you can use the actor for free at the beginning.

Once the Apify Proxy trial is expired, you'll need to subscribe to a [paid plan](https://apify.com/pricing) in order to keep using the actor. If you need to increase your Google SERP limit or have any questions, please email [support@apify.com](mailto:support@apify.com)

## Use cases

Google Search is the front door to the internet for most people around the world, so it's really important for businesses to know how they rank on Google. Unfortunately, Google Search does not provide a public API, so the only way to monitor search results and ranking is to use web scraping.

Typical use cases include:

- [Search engine optimization (SEO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization)
— Monitor how your website performs on Google for certain queries over time.
- Analyze display ads for a given set of keywords.
- Monitor your competition in both organic and paid results.
- Build a URL list for certain keywords. This is useful if you, for example, need good relevant starting points when scraping web pages containing specific phrases.

Read more in the [How to scrape Google Search](https://blog.apify.com/unofficial-google-search-api-from-apify-22a20537a951) blog post.

## Number of results
You can change the number of results per page by using the `resultsPerPage` parameter. The default is 10 but allowed values are 10-100. You can also set `maxPagesPerQuery` to get more results for each query.

Please keep in mind that, although Google shows that it internally found millions of results, **Google will never display more than a few hundred results per single search query**. You can try it in your own browser. If you need to get as many results as possible, try to create many similar queries and combine different parameters and locations.

## Input settings

The actor gives you fine-grained control over what kind of Google Search results you'll get.

You can specify the following settings:

- Query phrases or raw URLs
- Country
- Language
- Exact geolocation
- Number of results per page
- Mobile or desktop version

For a complete description of all settings of the actor, see the [input specification](https://www.apify.com/apify/google-search-scraper?section=input-schema).

## Results

The actor stores its result in the default [dataset](https://apify.com/docs/storage#dataset) associated with the actor run, from which you can export it
to various formats, such as JSON, XML, CSV or Excel.

The results can be downloaded from the [Get dataset items](https://www.apify.com/docs/api/v2#/reference/datasets/item-collection/get-items) API endpoint:

```
https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/[DATASET_ID]/items?format=[FORMAT]
```

where `[DATASET_ID]` is the ID of the dataset and `[FORMAT]`
can be `csv`, `html`, `xlsx`, `xml`, `rss` or `json`.

For each Google Search results page, the dataset will contain a single record, which in JSON format looks as follows. Keep in mind that some fields have example values:

```json

### How to get one search result per row

If you are only interested in organic Google Search results and want to get just one organic or paid result per row on the output, simply query the `fields=searchQuery,organicResults` and `unwind=organicResults` query parameters to the API endpoint URL:

```
https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/[DATASET_ID]/items?format=[FORMAT]&fields=searchQuery,organicResults&unwind=organicResults
```

The API will return a result like this (in JSON format):

```json
[
  {
    "searchQuery": {
      "term": "Restaurants in Prague",
      "page": 1,
      // ...
    },
    "title": "THE 10 BEST Restaurants in Prague 2019 - TripAdvisor",
    "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g274707-Prague_Bohemia.html",
    "displayedUrl": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g274707-Prague_Bohemia.html",
    "description": "Best Dining in Prague, Bohemia: See 617486 TripAdvisor traveler reviews of 6232 Prague restaurants and search by cuisine, price, location, and more.",
    "siteLinks": []
  },
  {
    "searchQuery": {
      "term": "Restaurants in Prague",
      "page": 1,
      // ...
    },
    "title": "The 11 Best Restaurants in Prague | Elite Traveler",
    "url": "https://www.elitetraveler.com/finest-dining/restaurant-guide/the-11-best-restaurants-in-prague",
    "displayedUrl": "https://www.elitetraveler.com/finest-dining/restaurant.../the-11-best-restaurants-in-prag...",
    "description": "Jan 16, 2018 - With the regional fare certainly a highlight of dining in Prague, a great number of superb international eateries have touched down to become ...",
    "siteLinks": []
  },
  // ...
]
```

When using tabular format such as `csv` or `xls`, you'll get a table where each row contains just one organic result. For more details about exporting and formatting the dataset records, please see the documentation of the [Get dataset items](https://apify.com/docs/api/v2#/reference/datasets/item-collection/get-items) API endpoint.

## Tips and tricks

* Crawling the second and further result pages might be slower than the first page.
* If you need to scrape a lot of results for a single query, then you can greatly improve the speed of the crawl by setting **Results per page** (`resultsPerPage`) to 100, instead of crawling 10 pages each with 10 results.

## Changelog
Google Search Results Scraper is under active development and we regularly introduce new features and fix bugs. We also often have to hotfix the extractor when Google changes the page layout. Check our [Changelog](https://github.com/apify/actor-google-search-scraper/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for recent updates.
